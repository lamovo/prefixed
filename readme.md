## Requirements

- [LESS](http://lesscss.org)

[All about LESS](http://lamovo.com/support/all-about-less)

## Included

### prefixed.less

Prefixed mixins matching CSS3 properties.

Big credit to [Peter Beverloo](https://github.com/beverloo) for providing the data behind the [Vendor-prefixed CSS Property Overview](http://peter.sh/experiments/vendor-prefixed-css-property-overview), which is used to generate `prefixed.less`.

### gradient.less

Linear and gradient mixin.

### transition-transform.less

Mixin for special cases where you want to set a `transition-property` to `transform` (with prefixes).

## Usage

For an example, take a look at `less/example.less`.
